To run the project, download the files, open the files in Unity (Unity 6), then run the game.


We developed a simple farming simulator game to replicate some technologies farmers do not have in 
their workflows (farmers in places with little access to tech, farmers who are unfamiliar with tech).  
This addresses the challenge by allowing the farmers to "demo" the tech in the simulation and see how 
it can benefit them. This is important because in this age, farmers are put up against a lot of new 
challenges like pollution, invasive species, and corporations trying to buy up their land, and a little
bit of help from technology can help the backbone of our society.
